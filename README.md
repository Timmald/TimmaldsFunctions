# TimmaldsFunctions:
This is a library of functions that I felt like needed to exist, or that just sounded fun or funny to make. 

**FUNCTION LIST:**

|  Function              |  Description              |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|
|  randChar()              |    gives a random character            |
|  randString(len)              |     gives a random string of length len           |
|    randShift(img,extremeness)            |      randomizes the colors of the given PIL.Image.Image object extremeness amount         |
|       bytesFromPath(path)         |     returns a bytes object that is the contents of the file at path. If it's a directory, returns the first file's contents           |
